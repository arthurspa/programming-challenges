This repository contains my solutions for some online programming challenges. Currently there are solutions for:
* [Hacker Rank](https://www.hackerrank.com/)

I'm using [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) along with [ms-vscode.cpptools](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.cpptools) to write and debug my solutions in C++. Some solutions done in Python.

Note: Solutions provided here do not follows best practices of software engineering. Instead, they're written in a way that allows me to solve a challenge as quick as possible.
