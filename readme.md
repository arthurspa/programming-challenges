# Solution for Online Programming Problems

This repository contains my solutions for some online programming problems. Currently there are solved problems for the following websites:
* [Hacker Rank](https://www.hackerrank.com/)
* [Uri Judge Online](https://www.urionlinejudge.com.br)
* [Open Kattis](https://open.kattis.com)
* [CodinGame](https://www.codingame.com)

I'm using [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) along with [ms-vscode.cpptools](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.cpptools) to write and debug my solutions in C++. Also, there are some solutions made in Python.

Note: keep in mind that usually the solutions won't be efficient nor optimal as I try to solve them in the fastest time possible.
